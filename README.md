## Proof of Concept (POC)

The core assumption of this project is that users can add expenses and see totals update dynamically. To validate this, a small proof of concept was created that allows users to input an expense amount and instantly updates the total on the page. This POC confirms that the main functionality of the SpendSmart Dashboard is technically feasible. In the full project, this same logic will be expanded to include multiple categories, a list of expenses, visual summaries, and a fully responsive dashboard layout.
